# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Throughout this course we were asked to utilize three different data structure types: vectors, hash tables and binary trees to sort through data. The main goal was to determine which data structure would be best to build a program that can sort, search and print from a list of courses, as well as information pertaining to them.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I first considered the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure, as well as the size of the data we were given to work with. For example, a vector would work best for data that isn't too large and the data would be unlikely to change in the future. If the program had to search through a large number of courses, then a vector would not have been as ideal.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
My biggest roadblock was learning and using C++. I understand how each data structure worked and when to apply them, but building them in a language I'm not too familiar with gave some trouble. I had to do a lot of independent research in order to correct errors and build them properly. 

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project helped me understand that programming is a workbench, and there are numerous tools at my disposal. I've come to understand that not every "tool" is best for each situation. 
Sometimes it's best to use a hash table over a vector, much like sometimes its best to use certain tools for certain jobs.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Keeping code structured in a neat, maintainable matter helps tremendously when working on it. Reducing the number of unnecessary functions, keeping comments brief but descriptive, and structuring the program properly will allow future updates and changes to be made by not only myself, but team members that are also working alongside me in then future.
